# NodeJS Random Album Art Generator

## Overview

A generator for photoshop-based forum games, where participants try to make fake album artwork using randomly selected text and artwork.

Wikipedia titles are used for the _album artist_, Wikiquote quotes are used for the _title_, and Unsplash photos for the _artwork_.

Developed during MLH LocalHackDay (December 2017), hosted at the University of Sheffield by HackSheffield.

## Installation
